#node-ipc test harness
*the test.js file is intended to start and run all of the files in the test folder*

A full regression test should be done before each release to npm to insure that no expected or previously documented bugs pop up again. 
This will also help to ensure that each new release does not create any additional bugs. However, it can never fully ensure no new bugs will be created. 
Any bug that is reported and testable, which should be 99.9% of bugs, should have a test written and added to the test folder after fixing.
